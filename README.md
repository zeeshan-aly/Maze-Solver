# Maze Solver App using Java Swing JFrame
The Maze Solver App using Java Swing JFrame is an application that allows users to create and solve mazes. This app is built using Java programming language and Swing graphical user interface (GUI) toolkit, which provides a user-friendly interface for maze creation and solving.

# Features
Create custom mazes by defining start and end points, walls, and pathways.
Solve mazes using various algorithms such as Breadth-first search (BFS), Depth-first search (DFS), A* algorithm, and Dijkstra's algorithm.
Save and load maze creations for later use.
User-friendly GUI interface using Java Swing JFrame.
